This Bash script performs log rotation and backup for the 'syslog' log file on an hourly basis.

Variable Definitions:

log_dir="/var/log": Specifies the log directory where log files are located.
backup_dir="/backup/logs": Defines the backup directory where rotated log files will be stored.
one_hour=$(date -d "1 hour ago" "+%Y%m%d%H%M%S"): Calculates a timestamp for one hour ago in the format YYYYMMDDHHMMSS. This timestamp will be used for renaming the log file and compressing it.

rotate_and_backup_logs Function:

log_file="syslog": Specifies the log file to be rotated (in this case, syslog).
current_hour=$(date "+%H"): Retrieves the current hour using the %H format.

Log Rotation and Backup:

- The script checks if the log file ("$log_dir/$log_file") exists.
- If the log file exists, it performs the following actions:
  - Renames the existing log file by appending the timestamp calculated for one hour ago ("$one_hour") to its name.
  - Creates a new empty log file with the same name as the original log file.
  - Compresses the old log file from one hour ago ("$log_file.$one_hour") using gzip command.
  - Moves the compressed log file to the specified backup directory ("$backup_dir/")
- If the log file does not exist, it prints an error message indicating that the log file was not found.

Hourly Rotation Loop:

- The script runs in an infinite loop (while true;) to continuously rotate logs every hour.
- Inside the loop, it calls the rotate_and_backup_logs function to perform log rotation and backup.
- After each rotation, the script sleeps for 3600 seconds (1 hour) using sleep 3600 command before rotating logs again.

Exit Code:

exit 0: This line is used to explicitly specify a successful exit status (exit code 0) for the script.
